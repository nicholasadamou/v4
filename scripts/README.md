# Scripts Directory

Utility scripts organized by purpose for build process, content preparation, and environment setup.

## Directory Structure

```

├── build/          # Build-time scripts (image caching, downloads)
├── setup/          # Environment and dependency setup
├── content/        # Content processing and preparation

```

## Build Scripts

### download-unsplash.js

### download-vsco.js

```bash
pnpm run download:images:vsco
```

## Setup Scripts

### check-submodules.js

Verifies and initializes git submodules (runs automatically in prebuild).

### playwright-env.js

```bash
node scripts/setup/playwright-env.js [tool-name]
```

## Content Scripts

```

## Build Workflow

```bash
pnpm format                        # Format code
node scripts/setup/check-submodules.js  # Check submodules
pnpm run download:images:unsplash  # Download images (optional)
pnpm run download:images:vsco      # Download images (optional)
pnpm run build                     # Build site
```

## CI/CD

All scripts gracefully handle CI environments:

- Missing submodules are detected
- Downloads are skipped automatically
- Build continues with fallback behavior
- Images fetched at runtime via API routes
