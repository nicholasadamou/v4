                . The simple yet captivating mechanics of navigating a spaceship
                and dodging asteroids sparked my curiosity about how computers
                worked and how games were created. This early fascination laid
                the groundwork for my interest in technology.

                . This required using developer tools to tweak some code, much
                like navigating through the layers of a game. The experience of
                seeing the code behind the scenes was reminiscent of my early
                days with Asteroids, as both experiences fueled my desire to
                understand and create within the digital world.
